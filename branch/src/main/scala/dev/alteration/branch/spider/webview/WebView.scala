/** Core trait for defining a WebView component.
  *
  * A WebView is a stateful, reactive UI component that lives on the server and
  * maintains state while sending updates to connected clients over WebSocket.
  *
  * Example:
  * {{{
  * case class CounterView() extends WebView[CounterState]:
  *   override def mount(params: Map[String, String], session: Session): CounterState =
  *     CounterState(count = params.get("initial").map(_.toInt).getOrElse(0))
  *
  *   override def handleEvent(event: String, payload: Map[String, Any], state: CounterState): CounterState =
  *     event match
  *       case "increment" => state.copy(count = state.count + 1)
  *       case "decrement" => state.copy(count = state.count - 1)
  *       case _ => state
  *
  *   override def render(state: CounterState): String =
  *     s\"\"\"
  *       <div id="counter">
  *         <h1>Count: ${state.count}</h1>
  *         <button wv-click="increment">+</button>
  *         <button wv-click="decrement">-</button>
  *       </div>
  *     \"\"\"
  * }}}
  *
  * Example with typed events:
  * {{{
  * sealed trait CounterEvent derives EventCodec
  * case object Increment extends CounterEvent
  * case object Decrement extends CounterEvent
  *
  * case class CounterView() extends WebView[CounterState, CounterEvent]:
  *   override def handleEvent(event: CounterEvent, state: CounterState): CounterState =
  *     event match
  *       case Increment => state.copy(count = state.count + 1)
  *       case Decrement => state.copy(count = state.count - 1)
  *       // Compiler enforces exhaustiveness!
  * }}}
  *
  * @tparam State
  *   The type of state this WebView maintains
  * @tparam Event
  *   The type of events this WebView handles (use String for backward
  *   compatibility)
